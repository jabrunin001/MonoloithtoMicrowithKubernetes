# Microservices Migration and Kubernetes Orchestration

This project demonstrates the migration of a monolithic application to a microservices architecture using Golang and Kubernetes.

## Prerequisites

- Docker
- Kubernetes cluster (e.g., minikube for local development)
- Istio
- ArgoCD (optional, for GitOps-style deployments)

## Setup and Deployment

1. Build the Docker image: docker build -t your-registry/user-service:v1 
2. Push the image to a container registry: docker push your-registry/user-service:v1
3. Deploy the microservices to Kubernetes: kubectl apply -f k8s/deployment.yaml
4. Install Istio: kubectl apply -f istio/istio-init.yaml
5. Create Istio resources: kubectl apply -f istio/istio-resources.yaml
6. Install ArgoCD (optional): kubectl apply -f argocd/argocd-application.yaml
7. Set up CI/CD:
- Configure Jenkins using the provided Jenkinsfile
- Set up ArgoCD using the argocd-application.yaml file

## Customization

- Update the `DATABASE_URL` and `REDIS_ADDR` environment variables in the `deployment.yaml` file to match your infrastructure.
- Modify the `Dockerfile` if you need to add any additional dependencies or build steps.
- Adjust the resource requests and limits in the `deployment.yaml` file based on your application's needs.
- Update the `VirtualService` and `Gateway` configurations in the Istio YAML files to match your domain and routing requirements.

## Monitoring and Logging

- Set up Prometheus and Grafana for monitoring
- Implement ELK stack (Elasticsearch, Logstash, Kibana) for centralized logging

## Security Considerations

- Ensure that all sensitive information (e.g., database credentials) are stored as Kubernetes Secrets.
- Implement HTTPS for all external traffic using Istio's TLS termination.
- Use Kubernetes RBAC to manage access to resources within the cluster.

## Scaling

- Adjust the `replicas` field in the `deployment.yaml` file to scale the number of pods.
- Implement Horizontal Pod Autoscaler (HPA) for automatic scaling based on CPU or custom metrics.
